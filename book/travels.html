<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>o the northeastern gate, a series of bridges known as Adamo’s Cross lap several small isles to connect the Arvegum Farmlands with Edelith’s East Fringe. These bridges, stony and wide, facilitated the flow of agricultural goods and foot traffic across Lake Adamo and into the walls of Inner Edelith.</p>

<p>Upon the central island was constructed a garrison to mediate the crossing, Fort Adamo. Whilst a strategic choke point curbing attempts at a northern invasion, Fort Adamo primarily proved its use in toll collection. The taxation and inspection of goods was commonplace during this time and the regulation of trade facilitated less outbreaks of disease within city boundaries.</p>

<p>During the Wake of Steel, Adamo’s Cross was met with a heavy influx of refugees consolidating from the Arvegum Farmlands and the Coronal Valley. Processing of citizens slowed down and many awaited clearance outside Fort Adamo for a chance to be admitted into the city. Meanwhile, Adamo’s Cross served as a gateway for Edelithian Ministry armies stationing in Arvegum for the upcoming Battle of the Black Valley. This increased panic led to a refurbishment of the stronghold, outfitting it with ballistae and reinforcements.</p>

<p>Upon the Ministry’s crushing defeat in the Coronal Valley, a last stand was staged at Fort Adamo against War’s demonic invasion. Remnants of Ministry armies held strongly at the Fort and successfully prevented further encroachment into Inner Edelith, at the cost mass casualties.</p>

<p>Sometime after the Wake of Steel, the fort would go abandoned without Ministry contact. Curiously though, a lady by the name of Madame Haema has taken responsibility for overseeing Adamo’s Cross. An elderly human seemingly too fair in appearance to have witnessed Old Edelith, she exchanges entering her service to crossing the bridges. Involving menial tasks such as cleaning the fort or cooking a meal, the lady’s standout traits are her unhealthy luncheon schedule with her husband and her “omniscience” within the fort.</p>

<p>Her acquisition to the garrison is a mystery as well, but evidence points to the cross being long abandoned after War’s onslaught. Despite its storied history, Adamo’s Cross still remains strong surrounded by the ruinous landscape.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>he Arvegum Plains, roughly defined as the region between the north-western River Flumen, the eastern Astora Mountains, and the Southern Lake Adamo, is known as the mouth of Edelith. Outside the city proper walls, the Arvegum Plains were known for their fertile soil that fed the mouths of Her city. The town of Arvegum, flowing out from the neck of Adamo’s cross outwards northernly, developed not too dissimilar to a melting pot. Residents originating from the capital melded with foreigners flowing in from the Coronal Highway and the coastal town of Cinis seeking work and refuge.</p>

<p>Sources elude to a yearly harvest festival being a noteworthy part of their calendar, however most documentation seems to have been destroyed or lost. The farming region already destabilized by Annuaterran cultists during the Great Solstitheian Schism, mobilization by the Ministry completely destabilized Arvegum during the Wake of Steel.</p>

<p>As Ministry armies demanded greater rations, city dwellers experiencing an influx in migration were stricken with famine from overcrowding. Chaos would unfold as protests erupted throughout the countryside, vandalizing Ministry accommodations and clashing with conscript militias. But, as a defeat in the Battle of the Black Valley signaled an end, Arvegum fell into total disarray as lifelong denizens desperately scrambled for safety. Retreating Ministry forces were caught up upon by War’s Flamehearts in the town. To my estimates, the ensuing slaughter wiped out approximately 95% of the remaining population. What remained of the Ministry Knights were crushed and Arvegum was mutilated beyond recognition into burning rubble.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>he demonology of Edelith, while taboo by the ministry to delve too deep within, is an intriguing topic of discussion nonetheless. At their core, demons are nothing but Corrosion made form. Each demon may have their distinctive features, but these can be attributed to a decoration on one's armor; it is purely asthetic on the shell. In fact, a demon's exterior is a flesh-like metal substance whilst the inside is the dark and goopy Corrosion.</p>

<p>Corrosion can exist outside of demons as its own living being in concentrated masses, but in order to truly be effective and cunning, a demon form would be needed. Demons, while varying in size, shape, and behavior, can be roped into three categories. The first and likely most common in Solstitheo are the monstrosity demons. Demons, who for the most part, are no different from the average monsters roaming around the land. With very little intelligence and only primal instincts, demons of this caliber are usually commanded by another subset of demons. They hunger only for flesh and metal and take on more "ghastly" appearances, uncanny to the eye.</p> 

<p>The next category of demonhood are the "higher form" demons. These demons are more humanoid than their kin and, unlike the snarling and ravaging primal demons, these ones possess a more elevated intelligence. Their cunning decieve travelers and their tactics makes feasting much more of a surer possibility. Some instances I have encountered in my travels are the Oni stalking the Arvegum Plains and War's Flamehearts whom fight in unison as hardened demons of the battlefield, besting the Ministry forces long ago.</p>

<p>The final main subset are the beasts. This type, not often seen, is inherently a contradiction. Ministry word dictates that beastial aspects such as the appearance of wolves, elk, or other natural creatures are connected with the divine and harness their power. So, it is almost paradoxical that even a demon from the depths could inherit such a form derived from the gods. Yet, they do exist in seemingly rare exception.</p>

<p> I did some studying previously on Jerren's hell hounds he has lying about his store. These beasts seem to more emulate that of a regular dog than be linked closer to the infernal. (Perhaps it is an animal mimicking a demon instead of the other way around?) The other prime example I have found is the Arvegum Beast.</p>

<p>This demon, said to resemble a large wolf or lion-like creature, was theorized by people in the university to be more ferocious than even the Flameheart forces besieging the countryside alongside it. While it can't be disproven, the legend of Kojin the Sword Saint highlights regardless that this Beast was fearsome. So far, my prevailing theory is that as a demon perfects itself towards a form of divinity, so too will these beastial aspects emerge. For all we know, the Arvegum Beast could have been a prime demon equivalent in power to the Horsemen. Relating to the topic of the Horsemen, the grey line surrounding demonology blurs across these four. Folklore points to these beings as angels corrupted and willingly tarnished by the Corrosion tainted metals of demons. But, considering how adverse Corroded metals are to life, I wonder how this coexistence is even possible.</p> 

<p>Are the Horsemen even still healthy and intelligible after all this time embracing demonhood? Why do demons follow their command? Are they even to be classified under the infernal, or are they more so a lower hierarchy of the Circlet's angels? To answer any of those questions, the fundamental ideas of how outside forces even comingle with the gods' powers must be unraveled. Author’s Note: I actually recall earlier into the Arvegum travels a handful of beast-like demons ambushing us at the Arvegum Ruins. The last notable sighting of such beast-like demons (to my knowledge at least) was in the Wake of Steel. So, where are they coming from...?</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">A</span>fter an extensive study and round of questioning of the New Arvegum citizens, I am confident in publishing my findings about this new construct legion. I have dubbed them, “The Woodsworn.” Identifiable by their humanoid appearance, wooden plating, and mask-like face, this “race” of beings is almost exclusive to New Arvegum. Their origins are questionable at best, however it is safe to say that these constructs emigrated into Edelith sometime after the Wake of Steel.</p> 
<hr />
<p><em>The next section is a written account of Woodsworn history retold by one of their own. For the sake of anonymity, the name of this individual has been censored. The individual will be referred to as "The Curator" in additional references to them.</em></p> <hr />

<p>"To start, I suppose I should detail a wee bit about what we truly are. We are living automatons, blokes made of wood and given life by our goddess, the Shrouded Lady, <b>Hiebrief</b>. No idea if we just gon' poof out of thin air or some smartie guy tinkered us up. But, we were made to serve one purpose—performing in the Trickster's Troupe. A wicked travelling circus, we put on magnificent shows for the people of Solstitheo. Rich or poor. Regardless of race or religion. Then, at night, things changed.</p> 

<p>Targets who attended the shows were killed under spotlights or sliced in 'performances gone wrong.' We were assassins, plain and simple. Hiebrief was our ringmaster and during the Great Schism, we were killing machines. Smiles grinnin' with blood." "Then, she buggered off. Just like that, Hiebrief booted out and ended the carnage. With nothin' to do, we wandered. Days on end. Then, when the demons came up from down unda, we had to flee. We are built the same, so none of us are strong enough defend another. After she disappeared, we were lost. But things got worse."</p>

<p>"There was this larrakin named Rotcio. He was a jester for the show and for his credit, could draw out a laugh from any mate. He betrayed all of us. One day, in the woods while me and rest were campin' out, he met a Beast in the woods. That thing whispered some idea into 'is head, that he could live forever.</p>

<p>They stuck a deal, the Corrosion could jump species and into the bark of trees. And in exchange, Rotcio, the bastard, would strip himself of his physical form. His crook head moved his own consciousness into the Corrosion, making him essentially immortal. And for the rest of us? <b>Left for dead.</b></p>

<p>Some of us had to be left in the decaying wood while we fled. Others nabbed scars never repairable. And Rotcio was never seen again. I'll never forgive 'im." "Wanderin' turned to runnin'. Fleeing forests scourged by the rot and demons trying to gorge on our 'hinds. And when we nodded off to rest, it turned worse.</p>

<p>Each of us didn't leave unscathed from the deal. We each grew a black ring in our bark, 'The Ring of Rotcio' we call it. It marked us for life and gives us haunted nightmares. Sometimes it is of the circus days, killing those peoples with no question. Sometimes it's Rotcio, beckonin' us to join him. Or, it is that Beast, taunting us that one day, we will fall into its ranks and there's nothing we can do."</p>

<p>"We met some man on the road. Not from around 'ere, I thought. He stayed the night with us bogans, warding off demons with his fancy blade. He offered us a smoke and, even though we have no lungs, we obliged. That night, no nightmares. He left without a word next mornin', but we were changed. And when we wound up in New Arvegum and found that same smoke, the rest of 'em signed up for an unlimited supply and service to the 'Son of Kojin' immediately. And, that how the story goes..."</p>

<p>During the interview, the Curator seemed to emotionally break down at parts. While his story may be true, a second opinion will confirm any theories. But, with the amount of Woodsworn dedicated to a "silent high" of Enfernabloom, sources are sparse.</p>
<p>Most of the race <em>(with a few striking exceptions such as the Curator and another individual)</em> serve as New Arvegum's guard. They are dressed in traditional Arvegum garb, most closely resembling the sacred robes the mythic hero Kojin dawned. They slay demons from the surrounding plains and deter them from the main city, never being allowed within the walls themselves.</p> 

<p>They are also usually "out-of-mind," acting static as constantly absorb Enfernabloom fumes from an added-on mechanism in their chest. Their arrival seems to have been in recent years and the main factor into the city's prominence. However, they are also seen as a lower sect of citizens. like basic machines designed to protect the city.</p> 

<div class="illuminated"><em><p>Author's Note: To conclude this study, sightings of "Rotcio" have been absent for now. With my conversation with the Curator, the Woodsworn seem entirely satisfied with their position and are not seeking any meaningful changes to the system. Finally, a running theory I have is that the nightmares these Woodsworn speak of may be impeded by memory, particularly memory loss. Though, more questioning at a later date will need to confirm this.</p> </em></div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">O</span>riginally thought to be simply a myth, hands on experience has proven the theory that the concept of the Serpentborne is factually proven. From scrying various local mythos, tales, and texts, I have accumulated a semi-firm understanding of the origins of the Serpentborne are.</p>

<p>According to legend, when the earth split open and the fissures birthed demons plagued with Corrosion, there were those who decended down into which these creatures came. Whether by choice or by tragedy, man and animal plunged into the fiery, sickening bowels of the land and faced demons head on. Many, especially those within towns that were entirely swallowed by the chasms, were met with a swift death upon. But, for those who survived and managed to scramble out of the depths in one piece, those would become the tainted Serpentborn.</p>

<p>Serpentborne are identifiable by the interlocking, crisscrossing metal strands seen on their skin. These seem to be a scar from their journey within Solstitheo's depths. Their namesake comes from their ability to shed off these metallic coils and ignite them into "living snakes." It is unknown if these snakes are completely independent of the Serpentborne or share the same senses are them. These snakes are demonic in nature and can converge and split off into larger and smaller snakes. They also hold ther capabilities to survive cold climates thanks to the intense, burning aura they emit.</p>

<p>As for the Serpentborne themselves, they hold the ability to weave these serpents as they wish, crafting various durable tools with them. More research will need to be conducted on the control Serpentborne exhibit on their snakes and if harming the snakes serves an extension of harming the user. Additionally, there are some feats mentioned within certain texts that hint towards a differnt nature for Serpentborne.</p>

<p>Appearances of reptile-like skin and fangs, spurting venom and spits of flame out of their mouths, vanishing completely into the night as a mass of snakes—it is dubious whether these statements are absolutely true or over-exaggerations. Serpentborne are dangerous and should not be befriended under any circumstances. All Serpentborne teeter the line of demonhood and their words are not to be trusted. They. Are. Deadly.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span> am first to report and debunk the running theory that the Coronal Valley is infertile and cannot support life. In fact, there is strong evidence to support the existence of living fauna and flora within the once though desolate wasteland, ravaged by war. From what I have observed, the Coronal Valley has made an almost complete and miraculous recovery of its ecological wildlife, completely transforming from a deadzone into a sustainable ecosystem.</p> 

<p>Forests and grasslands have grown over the battlefields of the Wake of Steel and civilization still is flourishing within the valley's heart. I, as a scholar, cannot believe it myself. For the past four days, my logging of the surrounding area has yielded promising results. This area shows all the main components of a thriving environment—biodiversity, abundance of nutrients, and stability. But, there are some major deviations from what I would consider "normal" in this valley. The trees and various other plants have grown to produce a magenta-purplish color of leaves. Same goes with the grass, adopting bluish tones as well. The streams glow pink and silver at night, yet the water seems almost fine.</p> 

<p>The livestock fed off this area seems extraordinarily healthy and very tame compared to the skittish herds in Edelith, like their primal instincts are being subdued. The demon populace is what really concerns me. While a rarity of "beast-like" demons trickled about the Arvegum Plains, they seem to be in abundance in the Coronal Valley. My personal hypothesis? They are slowly migrating from the Coronal Valley outwards through the Astoran Mountains. If so, the outcomes of this on the Edelithian ecosystem could be concerning...</p>

<p> The question that rings in the air is: how? Miraculous regrowth of a desolate area is rare, but not uncommon. There a plently of sources of divine intervention spurring revitalization—a prime example being the Edelith Pods of the southern wastes. However, regrowth to such a large scale is unprecedented. For such an abnormal event to even succeed, an amount of energy released by something such as an "Edelith Pod" would be massive. So massive in fact, that the regrowth initiative couldn't have gone unnoticed by even the people of New Arvegum across the mountain range.</p>

<p>There are some theories I am cooking up, but nothing set in stone. It seems unordinary but nevertheless is true. The Coronal Valley lives again. Author's Note: It feels wrong. Off. Strange. I don't like it. There's something afoot here. Forests don't magically appear out of nowwhere. Villages don't suddenly arise from ash. Horsemen don't just randomly appear. What is going on? I though I could trust Gorta, our guide through the forest. I don't anymore. She's behind this.</p>

 <p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>n light of recent ”revelations”, I am taken back to a sermon I attended in Macabrell. It was a time when I stopped by the Macabrell’s holy site, the Gilded Cathedral, to gather records on the settlement’s upbringing. The air was peaceful and the architecture was immaculate, arches stretching the ceilings and murals decorating the floors. This church, deprecated during the Great Schism, had been fully restored after Edelith’s fall. This is attributed to the members of the Golden Council. Preachers of the gods aligned under a single faith, their cooperation efforts have organized a society which the Ministry was absent.</p>
 
<p>The records I was searching for were misplaced, so I had plenty of time to burn. That led me to the preachings of a gold-skinned dragonborne deaconess. I sat down in the pews and idly took notes during the gospel for later use. I think now is the time for that use. I think that no story is complete without context. I’m no devout, I never have been. But, I have cross referenced the teachings of the Golden Council on other studies. As the Wake of Steel came to a close and the collapse of Solstitheo became inevitable, the gods no longer responded to their followers requests.</p> 

<p>The angelic forces would withdraw from battling alongside humanity and retreat towards their origin, their bastion—the Circlet. Without divine protection, all would crumble under the might of the demons as they invaded the capital. However, it is said that one angel remained. This transitions into the main figurehead of the Golden Council’s new faith: Aurelia. The compassionate and high ranking archangel of the gods, Aurelia remained within Edelith with the gods’ creations. With Her radiant might beside them, the Edelithians repulsed the grand demon invasion and preserved the sanctity of the city.</p>

<p>At the end of the Wake of Steel, in a battlefield smoldering with the ashes of War, Aurelia prophesied. The following is an account of what She decreed after the battle, passed down upon the ages as words of devotion: To powers exhausted hath delivered victory upon this land. Yet thine struggle for survival will’st remain prolonged. Mine fallen brothers, Heralds of the begotten Corrosion And the Blackened Beast who will be borne into thee darkest hour Must be slain and theirin essence receive benediction Lest the hand of sin take its wicked forme And sever the flesh of mine body. Bringing forth the end of the Edelithian Age and the prospects of war.</p>
 
<p>After the battle, Aurelia would disappear with no explanation. Her followers would adopt the Gilded Cathedral into an order devoted to Aurelia’s prophecy. And thus, those under Her order are sworn to live and fall pursuing the Horsemen.</p>

 <div class="illuminated"><p><em>Author’s Note: Must it be this way? Is it really by law that the Horsemen must die or the city is destroyed? Is there really no other alternative, no other reason to take? Is this truly how her life must end? I thought she was someone I could finally trust.</em></p></div>

Torthúil, Village of Abundance
Once though to be inhospitable for further attempts at civilization, the Coronal Valley has grown vastly since the Wake of Steel. But now, bringing back to the agricultural backwoods of the Solstitheo's Golden Age, this valley has once more laid humble beginnings in the pleasant country expanse. And so I have ended up in Torthúil, a small hamlet of the vibrant woods reborn. A community of roughly 30 to 50 individuals, Torthúil was able to flourish after the valley's revitalization.</p>

<p>It is settled on the western end of the valley, on the frontier of the floodplains formed from the countless wars waged eons before. Interestingly, it seems the populations is entirely formed of refugees, people who entered Edelith from the northeast through the mountains. There also exist those who crossed the Astoran Mountain range like I have, but they are few and far between. Most seem content to remain in New Arvegum to the south, the boundary of Edelithian oversight.</p>

<p>The town has suprisingly a very storied history. In fact, during my countless interviews with the locals, I managed to pry out countless tidbits of the nation's lore from those who ventured here! It was a relief for me since th...</p>

<p>The rest of the passage has been scribbled over in crayon. The following work appears to be done by another author:</p>
