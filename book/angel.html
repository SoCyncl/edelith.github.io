                    <p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>hile Edelith stirs with numerous independent factions, each trying to reestablish order within the demon plagued city, none live more in isolation than the quarry settlement in the Southwestern wastes, Tarpaul Pit. Developing a unique system not formed out of law, but out of respect, the residents of the colony exhibit much interest. Savagery leaves much room for innovation, after all. Although the Winds of Wastes’ ranks were mostly comprised of rehabilitated gang members, Baylis stood out as a dark horse. It was by Rampax’s suggestion that the heated Watchman be recruited to the skirmishing squad for his combat prowess.</p> 
                    <p>Rampax’s informality feuding with Baylis’ conduct would be a constant until their deaths. Skrapp is Edelith-born, Edelith-raised, and Edelith-thrived. Her parents, Shroudcrossers themselves, passed in her youth whilst they were on an archeology expedition. So, she turned to petty thieving gangs and developed her infamous “Whistle Knives” for easy snatch and grab gigs. Finding her place in the Winds of the Wastes, Skrapp is only driven by her sense of security and belonging. No one knows where in the Hells Soko came from. Some say she wandered in from the main city, looking for a change of pace. Others say she’s a Shroudcrosser taking her sweet time near the mouth of Edelith.</p> 
                    <p>There is only one certainty they know though; she is THE town drunkard.</p>
                    <br>

                   <p>Despite his peculiar demeanors, Svahnn is an Edelith native. He found himself as a guardsman for a militant faction of steel-wielders in Edelith before he deserted. But old habits die hard and he now resumes his duties risen in the ranks as a Head Watchman. Svahnn’s excuse for his accents? He picked up a few languages in Edelith. The Praying Mantis stirred up dust in General Strom’s personal quarters as a knife teetered near his neck. Hired as an assassin by one of the Pit’s first gangs, the Mantis could carry out her bounty as silently as the desert breeze. But, Strom offered her an unknown deal. Amelie accepted and went on to meet Rampax, the love of her life.</p>

 <p><span class="drop-cap">M</span>averick Malleum comes from a long lineage of steelsmiths from the north. However, the Wake of Steel compromised metalcraft and the trade was seen as taboo by the common folk. His signature work, “The Bone Bruiser Gauntlets,” are only an imitation of what his family forged. Gambol’s story starts in a Tarpaul Pit gambling ring when a risky bet on a roulette wheel ended with him gaining ownership of Pirouette. Then conveniently, a messenger is intercepted and, before he knows it, Gambol is the proprietor of the largest business operation in the Pit. His underlings call it luck. Gambol calls it finesse. The blessing of immortality in Edelith makes age deceiving and no further does it hold true than Khan Duster.</p>
 
  <p>A cargo conductor before the Wake of Steel, Duster was a refugee from Edelith after a demonic force laid siege to the Northwestern peninsula. Rumors say as an Old Edelitheian, he knows Strom’s worst secret. That seems to explain why the General treats him so harshly.</p>
 
  <p>Medals carry a weight to them. Immortality does not imply invigoration and old bodies wane over time in Edelith. To add onto that, medals gather Corrosion in their silvers and bronzes and they scar your skin. Fools say holding onto medals is like holding onto a painful memory, leading to revenge. But only a fraud knows that medals are the weightiest under the constant reminder that you need to live up to them.</p>
  <br> 
                  
                  
<p>Such interesting lives in such a mundane place. Though, if I were impressed by every civilization scrounged up in Edelith, my obsession would be over the insects burrowing in the ground. I do commend them for their ingenuity with our Edelith Pods. Nevertheless, the anomaly remains undetected. -L

       <h2 class="chapter-title2">The Steelside Legion</h2>
                    <div class="decorative-line"></div>
                    <div class="entry-date">3/28/2025 11:56 PM</div>
                    
                    <p><span class="drop-cap">S</span>ince our "withdrawal" from the city as a protecting force, a new organization of laymen has consolidated to defend the city. Observations have revealed their name, the Steelside Legion, and the intricacies of their leadership. Below is a manuscript of the report given on them, in the event they pique our interest in the future.</p> 
                    
                    <p>The Steelside Legion aims to restore order to the disorganized city of Edelith. They are first responders; handling most demonic threats that linger near the sparse settlements. While officially, they claim no ties to the governance of a new nation or any politics whatsoever, most communities keep them around for policing without too much of a worry. Though, heretics still be heretics.</p>
                    
                    <p>Their namesake is tied to their blasphemy; the use of metallurgy in their accessories. Be it weapon or armor, the Legion finds steel far more capable in combat than the wood and bone alternatives. All things considered, this practice is taboo and heretical to our fight against the Corrosion. Yet, what more could I care. Goners are called goners for a reason. To stave off Corrosion from taking hold, they have captured lightning itself.</p> 
                    
                    <p>An arcane canister known as "Thunderstroke" allows one to harness their metal as a conduit, surging an electrical current through the steel. Most promisingly, this acts as an unstable environment for Corrosion to take hold, creating a temporary resistance to the plague. But, it also enhaces the wielders. Blades now slice with cackling ferocity, bolts fire out like streaks of light through demon hide, and mechanisms overclock to the extremes to deliver efficient fatalities. I will say, I am impressed with their ingenuity this time.</p>

                    <p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>he Steelside Legion order is broken into a hierarchy. Beginning with Metalloids as the basic grunt force with no metallic enhancements, Alloys follow ranked as only partial members of the Legion, temporary but useful like mercenaries and shopkeeps. Yet, they play vital roles in the hierarchy, solidifying trade and alliances for what they cannot make up in strength.</p>
                      
                       <p>Ascending up the rungs, Ferrouses are next in line, known for intentionally or unwillingly possessing steel replacements of certain organs, limbs, and other body parts ranging in my sizes. These ones are the most reliant on Thunderstroke, as a crutch for what seems a disability. Nobles, as they are simply named, do not exude any higher societal status. Rather, they are almost fully reliant on metal enhancements and Thunderstroke to become heightened as warriors and commanders of the Legion.</p>
                       
                       <p>They earn much respect and are lifeblood of the organization, carrying out the will of "him." Known as the Purity, he is rumored to be almost fully metal and bathed electrical armor, immune to all Corrosion. He signals the nobles to mobilize at a whims notice but, otherwise, even to me he remains unknown. Quite enigmatic, this one. Most members of the Legions garner their names from the prosthetic they carry, shedding their old titles. They are a community, trying to restore Edelith to its former glory through innovative means. Still, every metal can carry imperfections.</p>
                         
                         <p> All threats in Edelith are unable to be quashed and, as demonic forces dig in to the Northeast, it is only inevitable that their greatest asset becomes their greatest folly. I wonder, how desperate must they be, cut off from their supply? </p>

                    <p><span class="drop-cap">O</span>h, how the city hath fallen into ruin. I almost felt a sense of pride, a sense of compassion when looking down upon the bustling city streets and the grandiose towers underneath golden Circlet light. But no longer. It is a shadow of its former self. Hovels masquerading as citadels. Macabrell, the Liturgical Town, lies in the Eastern Fringe of the city, cradled within the center of the quarter. It is a crossroads of sort, a blending pot of the distinct cultures of ruined Edelith. From the feudal nobility in the Western Fringe, the dockhands of Edelith Gothitas, or even the independent settlements of New Arvegum and the Bellum Citadel, Macabrell finds itself connected to all. But, the besieging of demons in the Northwest and Northeast has strained the town. Refugees book up any available rooms in the inn’s lodging and support to foreign campaigns have spread rations thin. The city gains its title as the Liturgical Town from the cathedral highlighting the square. It once stood as a testament to the Pantheon of Solstitheo, only rivaled by the grand monastery in the Stillight Quarter. While still maintaining its religious duties, the cathedral also serves as a protector. Most places of faith still flow with the glyphs of the gods, warding off demonkind. Thus, these etched marble monuments serve as proper places to begin a settlement.</p>
                    <br>


                  <p>Underneath the surface, candlelight stirs in Macabrell Catacombs. The streets overpopulated, many find solace in the abandoned tombs. Tents and impromptu shacks line once decorated altars, now abandoned with the absence of death. If the shadier side of this holy city is what you seek, the cretins of the Catacombs will welcome you in open arms.</p>
                    <br> 

                  <p>To teeter between life and death, what an interesting thought. Anomaly, how did you acquire such a status? To withhold something so divine so casually? You are alien to the natural order of Edelith, defying logic itself. I have been tasked to find you and when I do, I will put this dead meat back within its place. -L </p>

                        <p><span class="drop-cap">B</span>efore the Circlet, did Edelith shine bright? Before the Circlet, did men fear their deaths? Before the Circlet, was man at peace? Or has it always been a cycle of fighting, only perpetuated by our holy veil, which we used to protect the city from collecting dust? The Shroud of Aurum is failing; first the smallest of demons and now... thrashing beasts of iron lurk within the city. The Horsemen beckon all who hear their call. A call slowly growing louder on a demon's deaf ears...</p> 
                        
                        <p>In the heat of the Wake of Steel, man allied with divine in the effort to drive demonkind back within the rifts they had crawled out of. Yet, the metallic beasts were not alone neither. In defiance with their purpose given by the gods, four angels of the higher rungs of the Circlet betrayed their sworn deities and willingly gave in to the Corrosion. Each their own would divest their light, withering into mortality and transforming into commanders of this crusade; Four Horsemen.</p>
                        
                        <p>Now, even years after the Wake of Steel has diminished and ashes coat Edelithian streets, the Horsemen remain. Their very existence serves as a beacon to demonkind; a countdown for these wretched monstrosities to convulge onto the capitol and destroy life as we know it. They must be silenced if Edelith is to see a new day. Conquest is infamous in the badlands outside of Edelith and beyond greater Solstitheo. He seeks to subjugate all who may kneel and has amassed a force larger than any Edelithian army.</p> 
                        
                        <p>He has razed grand cities, slaughtered hundreds of innocents, enslaved the weak to feast upon later, and is a wicked individual. The Horseman has set his sights upon Edelith. For a decade, a coalition of Steelside Legion forces and the Edelithian Church have staved off their approach in Edelith Gothitas, even making significant progress defeating his Construct Guard. But as of late, a Corrosive haze has settled over the region. It is unknown the status of Conquest's armies. Nevertheless, the old king must be slain.</p>
                        
                        <p>Famine has not shown their face for a while in Edelith. Tales tell of the horrid hunger that follows wherever they ride their steed, guiding man to slowly succumb to a slow starvation. In an attempt to satiate the void that purges their soul, they say Famine will feast on any warm blooded creature; whether that be person or livestock. Though, these still only remain rumors. Bedtime stories meant to stir the wild imaginations of New Arvegum children so that they do not wander far from the city walls.</p>

                        <p><span class="drop-cap">B</span>ut every lie hides a truth and tales of this beast will tie to Famine, one way or another. War has plagued the Edelith since the emergence of the Wake of Steel. Proclaiming the fall of the Circlet of the Sun, Edelith was once on the forefront of the of the tyrant's assault.</p> 
                        
                        <p>Waves upon waves of demonkind ravaged the city into the desolate shadow it exists in the present day. Facing the full brunt of the Circlet's angelic power, War was routed and his soldiers banished into the bowels of Edelith's dungeons. But, War is persistent and still lives. In the charred countryside of Edelith at mouth of the Bellum Citadel, the Horseman still skirmishes for a taste bloodshed, leading his savage brothers into deadly combat.</p>
                        
                        <p>Despite the impending death, to wage battle against War is to indulge in a novelty. And thus, the strongest Edelithians compete in the coliseums of New Arvegum, proving their might to face demonhood head-on as a part of the Bellum Citadel draft. The Horseman of Death is unknown. No legends surround it. Now glorious triumphs or frightening mysteries. Only an unnerving, horrible silence. However, we do know one thing for sure; its location. The new city founded as a paradise against the tragedies of the outside, warring world. It is cut off from the rest of the city, its elevators either long ago collapsed or inaccessible. Located between two mighty dams and underneath the very Circlet itself is the dark Umbra. We are certain that is where Death lurks. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Traitors, all. They harness the Corrosion and for what? Prolonged suffering, devoid of the light of the Circlet? It is the light which commands us, which gives us purpose to trancend humanity into pure bliss. Why must I kid myself.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I have received orders. Those of the higher rungs await results. In one week, the Anomaly must be found. I cannot stop now. Our breakthrough, Anomaly, it awaits us. You have changed it all. I will find you. I must. It is my duty. And you are my paragon, disrupter of the divine. -L</p>

                    <p>Working with the Ministry, Yordenriser and his company would use their wealth to construct the classrooms of Sköllarium University. Over time, more and more scholars from across the nation would accumulate, leading to breakthrough innovations of runic magics, light transposition, and complex machinery.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Yordenriser, for his outstanding impact left on Edelith and Solstitheo, would be awarded the title of Cardinal by the Ministry's Grand Priestess before his retirement. With the tide of the Wake of Steel, the university's focus shifted less towards urban development, and more towards war technology. Calling in many scholars from the reaches of Solstitheo, the greatest minds came together to brainstorm ideas for combatting the oncoming demon invasion.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Their wits would be tested in the most impactful battle of Edelith, the Battle of the Black Valley. Combating War's encroaching forces as a last line of defense into Edelith, Sköllarium University's weapons light-beam weapons employed in Coronal Valley caused unprecedented destruction. The end result of the all-out war was a complete ecological death for the valley, reducing the wildlife to earthen waste.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">B</span><p>As the demons' assault of the Capital worsened, Sköllarium University moved towards an untested contingency plan. Dr. Nikolas, a grand wizard and artificer from the outlands, headed the project. Refining earlier studies on light refinement and Refraction, the Upper Quarter of Edelith would be reinforced by arcane lanterns that could detect demonic presences entering the walls.</p>
                        
<p>Emerging from the pale lights, composed of only rays of magical radiance, polygonal guardians dubbed Glass Angels would defend the quarter from the fiendish reckoning. However, an error in the runic encoding caused man to be indistinguishable from beast and the Stillight Quarter would become an everlasting testament to the university's misguidings. Escapees of the quarter would found their own branch classroom within the flourishing settlement of Macrabell. Its new curator of Headmaster Samael, the Luminessence of an angel contained within the stone statues of the lecture halls, continues to seek a way for Edelith to flourish. The institute has directed its new focus on the city's repair, dissipating the Glass Angels and resuscitating the barren wastelands.</p>
