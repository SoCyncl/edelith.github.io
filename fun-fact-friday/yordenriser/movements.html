                      <h2>THE MOVEMENTS OF THE HIGH PRIESTESSES</h2>
                      <hr>
    
                      
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the religious confusion and anarchy <em>the Heretical Movement</em> spurred in Edelith, a divine lineage of High Priestesses have risen to the throne as sovereigns of the Aurumic Church. A set of divinity-chosen matriarchs, each pure maiden manages the Aurumic religion and are said to manipulate the fate of the nation with their song. Their melody, which is used to harmonize the citizens of Solstitheo into one golden chord, is often shared by numerous High Priestesses throughout the ages to establish long-lasting eras of prosperity. Thus, each era of Solstitheian history is categorized by the High Priestess who founded the ballad and cultivated their vision for the Golden Nation.</span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Sonatan Movement</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Heretical Movement was seen by the gods as an era of false prophets who led the people of Solstitheo down blasphemous paths. To rectify this sinful guidance, it is written that the first High Priestess, Sonatan, was personally selected as Choir Maiden of the Aurumics to unite the faithful and rebuke the sacrilegious. In this new era, the Sonatan Movement, Solstitheo made rapid territorial expansions and founded the thematic institutions which still linger to the present day. The Sonatan Movement swayed the most pious followers of the Aurumics, fastening a tight hold on the city of Edelith. As the movement progressed, followers of the High Priestess would run campaigns in the Solstitheian region against heretical prophets and liberate their followers into the true voice for the gods. The aristocrats and priests of the Golden Nation rose into prominence as the highest authorities, establishing the Ministry and the Aurumic Church. A balance between the five deities was sanctified under the Sonatan melody, encouraging a harmonious existence with other Aurumic acolytes. Several doctrines were created within this movement as well such as the consecration of gold and the natural aspects, the revilement of the Blind Lords and any other mineral-born creatures, and the demonization of heretics and those who disrespect the High Priestess&rsquo; authority. Once the last of the heretic lords were conquered or driven out of the Solstitheian region, people agreed that an era of peace would be required to ensure the longevity of the nation. So, the Sonatan melody was retired.</span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Adagian Movement</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A wise sage of the west, High Priestess Adagio cooled the expansionary ambitions of Solstitheo, focusing instead on the development and reticulation of the nation&rsquo;s faith, technology, and culture. She would sing a new melody to be reprised, one of slower cultivation and appreciation. With this new movement came the growth of settlements and towns across Solstitheo, forming the once scattered villages into a coherent and connected system. Trade flourished at this time with new routes opening across the empire. It inspired a renaissance in the arts and magics, founding the traditional Adagian architecture of grand, golden structures and making breakthroughs in glyph channeling to ward off the monsters who roamed the untempered wilds. This era was not without conflict though, as an assault from the warlord &ldquo;Crimson Beak&rdquo; was repelled by a softened military coalition. For, while the Adagian Movement made staggering internal improvements, foreign relations were weakened by a reluctance to interact with emerging nations. The Solstitheian citizens protested the restrictions on regional influence, and the Adagian melody was ultimately retired.</span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Scherzian Movement</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Old Light delegate who was adopted by a former High Priestess, High Priestess Scherz crafted and articulated her melody to more openly encourage Solstitheians to interact and find allegiance within the lands of the wider world. Edelith opened to overseas trade, bringing an abundance of new citizenry and goods from the Neapean Seas and elsewhere. Racial tensions lessened as her melody harmonized a unity along shared national heritage. With rising prosperity, Solstitheo became a center for the elites of the lands to meet, boasting grand ballrooms and productive skylines. New industries allowed the expansion of the Canals and Edelith Gothitas within the capital city, becoming a trading hub of the west. Ancient relics and texts were also collected by the Edelithians, spurring the creation of the Ministerial Library in the central district where gathering scholars could discuss and innovate new ideas. The largest advancement in the Edelith was the Grand Lyria Canal which, while finalized in the following era, brought financial success and national hope throughout all districts of the city. With shrinking room in the metropolitan areas, the Scherzian Movement also drove Solstitheians out west to the desert regions bordering Torrido. The era ended abruptly when a foreign act of violence erupted in Edelith, burning down the Ministerial Library, and retiring the Scherzian melody for a more active movement.</span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Rondolian Movement</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agreed by many scholars to be the height of the Solstitheian nation, the Rondolian Movement was founded by the supreme ranking priestess of the Aurumic Church at the time of the prior high priestess&rsquo; death. Many in Solstitheo awaited change. So, when a new melody promised grandiose magnificence for the kingdom, many welcomed it with open arms. The Rondolian Movement started strong by rebuilding the tarnished Ministerial Library as Sk&ouml;llarium University. The Golden Nation&rsquo;s technological advancements reigned supreme in this era as new innovations in glyphs and magical constructs revolutionized Edelithian industry. With the wealth of the preceding movement, temples, trading halls, clocktowers, and other grand structures stood as the pinnacle of Edelithian architecture. A highway system, stretching from Edelith, through the Coronal Valley, and across the Astoran Mountains to the northeast, facilitated stable trade and movement across the kingdom. Old Lights benefitted most from this movement, gaming preposterous amounts of wealth through their investments within Edelith. Peace would be felt across the land as tensions towards foreign peoples were eased and religious freedom was allowed. Despite this golden age, progression abruptly ended in favor of an emerging movement under High Priestess Ferman.</span></p>
