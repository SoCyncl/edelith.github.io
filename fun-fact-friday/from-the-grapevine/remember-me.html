                      <h2>REMEMBER ME</h2>
                      <hr>
    
                      
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mom,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I made a lot of friends. I know you said after I cross the line by the trees by our house, I&rsquo;d be on my own. But I felt like I just needed to write to you, to pretend you&rsquo;re right here. To feel like you&rsquo;re next to me. Especially now, it&rsquo;s a very stressful time, but not for me, I&rsquo;m okay so don&rsquo;t worry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right after I left I remember i met a blue chicken, I thought nothing of it until it started asking me for more seeds, which was funny because animals aren&rsquo;t supposed to talk. I thought it was one of those monsters you talked about so I chased it until it transformed into a blue slime thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked what its name was, and introduced myself because you said I need to have manners. It didn&rsquo;t have one so I called it Blobert, like the fox we had. Atleast I think. Or was it bobert? Fobert? Something like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I made a mask of him, remember? I still have it, with all the other ones we carved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the animals you cared for in that forest, I still have masks of them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You said when someone dies, their spirit inhabits things that look like them. Trinkets and&nbsp; things they cared about. Or even inhabit things we make specifically for them. That&rsquo;s why I made masks of them, you always looked sad when they dissapeared, so I made them so they&rsquo;re still here, so you wouldn&rsquo;t be sad. Because you always look sad, and I just want to make you a bit happier.</span></p>
<p class="demoTitle">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fox and that stag, and the porcupine. Because I want to mourn over them. Because they don&rsquo;t get funerals like us. Animals don&rsquo;t get funerals like us. I hope their spirits live in those masks. I want to tell their stories. It&rsquo;s why I take care of them so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And because we carved them together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, I forgot I mentioned Blobert, they&rsquo;re great. I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re a a boy or a girl, I asked them and they said they&rsquo;re a slime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You said you were worried about me making friends out there, but don&rsquo;t worry! I made an amazing friend. I made a mask of them, it&rsquo;s a chicken. Even thought they&rsquo;ll be alive for a long time, I think I just like making masks of events. They tell stories, and i want to show that. Or because it helps me remember.</span></p>
<p class="demoTitle">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&rsquo;s also the Beast of the north, I think was his name. He&rsquo;s huge! Bigger than that really big tree stump behind our home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He&rsquo;s got this really cool hat and wears a big bear pelt. I knew as soon as I saw him, I had to make that a mask! And when we fought I gave it to him to help him. But don&rsquo;t worry! Im fine! I was never hurt. Please don&rsquo;t worry about me, it was just some guys that were mean to us, but Peggle, that&rsquo;s his real name, took care of us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I really admire him, he&rsquo;s stoic, and strong. He talks about his neice a lot and wears stuff she made and I know he loves her a lot. I hope you talk like that to the animals about me. When someone is trying to be mean he stands up for me and Blobert. I don&rsquo;t know if I mentioned him, I&rsquo;ll tell you later.</span></p>
<p class="demoTitle">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had a little disagreement when we tried to help some people made of sand and it hurt a little. You told me to help anyone as soon as the opportunity comes. Don&rsquo;t be mad at me, but I couldn&rsquo;t help them, I&rsquo;m sorry. But Peggle, that&rsquo;s his real name, said we&rsquo;ll help them eventually. I saw lizards across the sand after the sand people left, and made masks of them. We&rsquo;ll be back for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is, I miss you, I miss you a lot. We&rsquo;re doing a lot of things here, I can barely remember, I&rsquo;m so sick of it, so sick of not being able to remember basic things, but thankfully they keep me around. Atleast they remind me what to do, I&rsquo;m lucky to have them, I really am.</span></p>
<p class="demoTitle">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to kill a kind lady, she looks like you. She looks like you a lot. And, I don&rsquo;t want to kill her because I don&rsquo;t want the thought of hurting someone that looks like you in my memory. I don&rsquo;t want to risk that being the only thing I remember. I want my only permenant memory to continue to be your songs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No person who loves their mother can stomache the idea of killing them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it just made me miss you horribly. I shouldn&rsquo;t have came out here, I should have stayed next to you while you were sick, I should have taken the deal with this one guy, he said he&rsquo;d cure corrosion and for some reason I just prioritized other people instead of you. I forgot you have corrosion. Had I just remembered then you could&rsquo;ve been better by now, it&rsquo;s all my fault. It&rsquo;s always my memory, it&rsquo;s always my memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll find Avao. I think I&rsquo;m getting close to finding him. People keep calling me Avao, but you said if they do that it&rsquo;s because I look just like him. I know you love him, I can remember you sitting near the table in the living room holding your head, looking at letters he sent you and not saying a word for hours. You said he was in Edelith. I promise I&rsquo;ll find him, and we&rsquo;ll return safely. Then you&rsquo;ll be happy.</span></p>
<p class="demoTitle">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;ll be safe, I promise to be aware of my sorroundings, and take notes of what happens to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I&rsquo;ll wash my clothes when I can too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I&rsquo;ll write letters to you every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, and.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I promise I&rsquo;ll find a cure for your sickness, and I&rsquo;ll find my brother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please don&rsquo;t worry about me, I have the flute you gave me too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So <strong>remember me.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love you</span></p>
<p class="demoTitle">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I come back home, I&rsquo;ll show Blobert and Peggle the house you built us, and the cool animals we have.</span></p>
<p class="demoTitle">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please write back when you can, send it to Tarpaul Pitt and address it to Skrapp, that&rsquo;s the general of tarpaul pit and he knows me well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love you, please write back soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash; Your son, always</span></p>
<p class="demoTitle">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I miss you.</span></p>
<p class="demoTitle">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash; Herb.</span></p>
<p class="demoTitle">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please write back. Please.</span></p>
<p class="demoTitle">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash; Your son Herb.</span></p>
